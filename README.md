SOFTWARE CONSTRUTION LAB 2:
---------------------------
---------------------------
Introduction:
 Following things are performed in this lab:
  •	Library created which has three functions
    o	Iterative multiplication of matrices
    o	Strassen’s multiplication of matrices
    o	Check if the subtraction of both matrices is zero
  •	Unit test for this library
Approach:
  •	Function for iterative multiplication
      o	Iterate through both matrices and calculate the sum by multiplying (mxp if (mxn) is order of first matrix and (pxq) is order of second). 
  •	Function for strassens
      o	Use divide and conquer to divide matrix and then unite it again and find the product
  •	Equal method to check that the answer of both the methods
    o	Take the result of both methods 
    o	Subtract both
    o	If the answer is zero then the test is running correctly
