SOFTWARE CONSTRUTION LAB 2:
---------------------------
---------------------------
Introduction:
  A matrix multiplication library is written which perform multiplication using iterative and Strassen's algorithm. 
  Following things are performed in this lab:
    1. Library created which has three functions
       a. Iterative multiplication of matrices
       b. Strassen’s multiplication of matrices
       c. check if the both results are equal
    2. Unit test for this library 
Approach:
    1. Function for iterative multiplication
       a. Iterate through both matrices and calculate the sum by multiplying (mxp if (mxn) is order of first matrix and (pxq) is order of second).
    2. Function for strassen's algorithm 
       a. Use divide and conquer to divide matrix and then unite it again and find the product
    3. Equal method to check that the answer of both the methods
       a. Take the result of both methods 
       b. Check the equality of both anwsers using Arrays.equal
